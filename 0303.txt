. lib is not needed. use LIBRARY Load Path, and plink output
2. When undefined symbol is found, usually it's header and lib version mismatch
3. use -Wl,--verbose to find out which library is found successfully.
4. need to update the headers using 
    cd robo_big_trunk/opt/bb/include
    dst=~tma91/mbig/refroot/refroot/opt/bb/include
    cp bsl_* $dst
    cp -fr gtest $dst
